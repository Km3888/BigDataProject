# BigDataProject
Final project for Spring 2021 Big Data Course

To reproduce our data cleaning results, create a new conda environment and load the required packages by running 'conda install --name [env_name] --file requirements.txt'. Then run 'jupyter-notebook' and open data_cleaning.ipynb to run the code.
